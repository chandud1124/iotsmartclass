# Tailwind CSS Setup Guide

## âœ… Issues Fixed

The following Tailwind CSS configuration issues have been resolved:

1. **Unknown @tailwind directive errors** - Fixed by disabling CSS validation and adding custom data
2. **Missing IntelliSense support** - Added Tailwind CSS language support
3. **Build process working** - Confirmed Tailwind CSS compiles correctly

## ðŸ”§ Configurations Applied

### VS Code Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- Disabled CSS/SCSS/LESS validation to prevent unknown at-rule errors
- Added Tailwind CSS custom data for better IntelliSense
- Configured language support for TypeScript and React files
- Added experimental class regex for `cva()` and `cx()` functions

### Custom Data File (`.vscode/tailwind.css-data.json`)
- Defined Tailwind directives (`@tailwind`, `@apply`, `@layer`, `@config`)
- Added documentation links for better developer experience

### Recommended Extensions (`.vscode/extensions.json`)
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Prettier
- TypeScript Importer
- Auto Rename Tag
- Path Intellisense

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Install Recommended Extensions**: VS Code will prompt you to install the recommended extensions
2. **Restart VS Code**: Reload the window to apply all settings
3. **Verify Setup**: The "Unknown at rule @tailwind" errors should be gone
